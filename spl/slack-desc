# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

spl: spl (Solaris Porting Layer (SPL))
spl:
spl: The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which
spl: provides many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes
spl: it possible to run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with
spl: relatively minimal modification. This can be particularly useful
spl: when you want to track upstream Solaris development closely and
spl: don't want the overhead of maintaining a large patch which converts
spl: Solaris primitives to Linux primitives.
