# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fakeroot: fakeroot (Gives a fake root environment)
fakeroot:
fakeroot: This package is intended to remove the need to become root for a
fakeroot: package build. This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
fakeroot: which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod, stat, and
fakeroot: so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.  fakeroot requires
fakeroot: SYSV IPC or TCP to operate.
