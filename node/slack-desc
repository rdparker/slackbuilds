# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

node: Node.js is similar in design to and influenced by systems like
node: Ruby's Event Machine or Python's Twisted.  It takes
node: the event model a bit further - it presents the event loop as a
node: language construct instead of as a library.  Node.js is bundled
node: with several useful libraries to handle server tasks : System,
node: Events, Standard I/O, Modules, Timers, Child Processes, POSIX,
node: HTTP, Multipart Parsing, TCP, DNS, Assert, Path, URL, Query Strings.
