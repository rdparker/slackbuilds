# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

template:
template: The Solaris Porting Layer (TEMPLATE) is a Linux kernel module which
template: provides many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes
template: it possible to run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with
template: relatively minimal modification. This can be particularly useful
template: when you want to track upstream Solaris development closely and
template: don't want the overhead of maintaining a large patch which converts
template: Solaris primitives to Linux primitives.
