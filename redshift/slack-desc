# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

redshift: redshift (Display color temperature adjustment)
redshift:
redshift: Redshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to
redshift: your surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are
redshift: working in front of the screen at night.  The color temperature
redshift: is set according to the position of the sun. A different color
redshift: temperature is set during night and daytime. During twilight and
redshift: early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly from
redshift: night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly adapt.
